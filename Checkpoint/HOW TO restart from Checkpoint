Step 1)
Copy the checkpoint file into SWE/build folder.

Step 2)
Modify "switchScenario" on SWE/src/examples/swe_simple.cpp line 156 to the number 3.

Step 2)
Modify "CHECKPOINT_FILE" on SWE/src/scenarios/SWE_Checkpoint.hh line 16 to the name of your checkpoint file.
OR rename your checkpoint file to "_00.nc" in the build folder

Step 3)
Compile and rerun the simulation with the result with same paramater.

e.g if you use "Checkpoint of ArtificialTsunamiScenario100x100x200x2.nc",
use the command 
>> ./SWE_gnu_release_none_fwave -x 100 -y 100 -t 200 -b 2 -o "../build/" <<
